Advanced House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses the **Ames Housing Dataset** to predict house sale prices using machine learning. It is beginner-friendly and runs entirely in **Google Colab**, making it easy to use with no installations.


 Features

1. Load and clean real-world data  
2. Handle missing values  
3. Encode categorical features  
4. Train/test split  
5. Train Random Forest Regressor  
6. Evaluate with MAE, MSE, RMSE, R²  
7. Visualize predictions vs actual  
8. Export the trained model
